  <h2>About Roy Tours</h2>
  <p><strong>Welcome to Roy Tours</strong> — your trusted partner in exploring the soul of India. We are not just a travel company; we are your local friend who takes you beyond sightseeing into the heart of every destination. Whether it’s a peaceful village retreat, a vibrant cultural experience, or a nature-filled escape, we create journeys that stay with you forever.</p>

  <p><strong>Our Origin:</strong> Roy Tours was born with a simple dream — to make travel affordable, authentic, and accessible to everyone. Coming from a humble background, our founder Bhaskar Kumar always believed that tourism shouldn’t be limited to cities and five-star hotels. He wanted to bring people closer to real India — the villages, the people, the traditions, and the untouched beauty.</p>

  <p><strong>Our Mission:</strong> We aim to empower rural tourism while giving travelers meaningful experiences. Every trip with Roy Tours supports local communities, promotes eco-friendly practices, and builds cultural bridges between travelers and locals.</p>

  <p><strong>What Makes Us Different?</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Authentic Village Experiences:</strong> Stay with local families, participate in festivals, visit organic farms, and learn traditional crafts.</li>
    <li><strong>Personalized Travel:</strong> No fixed templates — we curate every trip based on your interests, budget, and travel goals.</li>
    <li><strong>Affordable and Transparent:</strong> No hidden costs. We believe in simple, honest pricing.</li>
    <li><strong>Local Empowerment:</strong> 80% of what you pay directly goes to local hosts, guides, and artisans.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Our Team:</strong> We’re a passionate group of local guides, techies, artists, storytellers, and nature lovers. From our tour planners to your village hosts — everyone is focused on making your journey comfortable and unforgettable.</p>

  <p><strong>Safety & Comfort:</strong> All our trips are planned keeping your safety and comfort in mind. Verified homestays, hygienic food, and 24/7 support — so you can travel worry-free.</p>

  <p><strong>Join Us On This Journey:</strong> Whether you're a solo traveler looking for peace, a couple seeking romance, or a group of friends craving adventure — Roy Tours has something special for everyone. Let us take you away from the usual and into the extraordinary.</p>

  <p>Thank you for believing in small dreams that make a big difference. Welcome to the Roy Tours family — where your journey is personal, and your memories are everlasting.</p>
